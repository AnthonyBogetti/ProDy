hpb is a python module written for calculating the hydrophobic interactions and solvent
accessible surface area using geometric method. The original program is in C++, so the
module is an interface to call functions in C++.

Follow the stpes to compile the C++ code into the *.so file of module (note that the directory to include python may need change):

cd libf2c
make -f makefile.l hadd
make -f makefile.l

cd ..

to compile the program for python 3.8 use:
g++ -O3 -g -fPIC -c hpbmodule.cpp -o hpbmodule.o -I/usr/include/python3.8/

and further:
g++ -shared -Wl,-soname,hpb.so -o hpb.so hpbmodule.o reg_tet.o ./libf2c/libf2c.a -lm


############################
After compiling the code, the module 'hpbmodule.so' file is created and user can import the module in python.
Try one example program 'testh.py' to use the functions in it.
Two functions hpb.hpb and hpb.sasa are writtein in the same module. The inputs to call them are the same.
The outputs are now in lists, with every element contains the information for one hydrophobic interaction or SASA value of one residue.
